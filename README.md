### Control attack speed, ignoring minecraft attack cooldown system

Minecraft damage system is nice, but we want to add bonus os items. So the problem are the [attack cooldown calculation](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Damage#Attack_cooldown "attack cooldown calculation").

Example: If you can do a hit every 1 second, and you hit on 0.5 second, your damage will be calculated by the table, and not will cause 100% of damage

To control that, we remove minecraft attack speed and do our attack speed system. Now,you can hit only when you can hit, and all attack cause 100% of the damage
